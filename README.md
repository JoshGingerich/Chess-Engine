# Chess Engine Project
This engine was created for a university honors project. The main purpose of the project was to develop a well-structured software program that utilizes interfaces to keep it consistent and easier to modify. The other purpose of the project was to develop an AI algorithm called alpha beta minimax. A GUI was created so that the user could intuitively interact with the chess engine.
