# Chess Engine Project
This engine was created for a university honors project. The main purpose of the project was to develop a well-structured software program that would utilize interfaces to keep the program consistent and easier to modify. The other purpose of the project was to develop and work with an AI algorithm called alpha beta minimax. A GUI was created so that the user could intuitively interact with the chess engine.

As the image below shows, this engine was able to beat a 1600 rated Stockfish engine, which roughly indicates the rating level of this engine. For comparison to humans who play chess regularly, the average rating is aproximately in the 1200-1500 range.
