# Chess Engine Project
This engine was created for a university honors project. The main purpose of the project was to develop a well-structured software program that would utilize interfaces to keep the program consistent and easier to modify. The other purpose of the project was to develop and work with an AI algorithm called alpha beta minimax. A GUI was created so that the user could intuitively interact with the chess engine.
